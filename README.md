Flaky Snakey
============

Flaky Snakey is a first year university project I done where we had to make a game inspired by the classic Snake game using object-orientation techniques to achieve the goal. It was made using GCC 4.8.2 on Linux and hasn't been tested on any newer version. A Windows build is available on the release page.
